To start off with: this program was created as a proof-of-concept for a new
kind of technical diagramming tool. Because it is a proof of concept, don't
expect great usability - I do hope that will come one day, but it isn't the
primary goal at this point.

The concept being proven is that it's possible to build a diagramming tool out
of only truly primitive components: lines, arcs, etc. Modern diagramming tools
provide lots of other primitives, for example rectangles, rectangles with
rounded corners, rectangles that contain text and resize with the text and
various other more complex shapes. This program attempts to prove that all of
these components can be created within the illustrator program.  Only the truly
primitive objects will be created in C code.
